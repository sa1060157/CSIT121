        <h2>Lab 1 & 2 Reflection</h2>
    <p>My first blog! When I first started this course, I felt very anxious about it, but as I've been learning different things based off of structuring HTML and learning Web Standards, I have felt better about it. Lab 1 was sort of tricky for me, as I submitted the assignment wrongly, but when I tried it again, I started to realize what I was doing wrong.</p>
        <h2>What I learned</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>How to publish my own HTML file</li>
            <li>How to structure texts in HTML structure</li>
            <li>How to identify HTML elements</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Learning about HTML structure, publishing HTML files, and identifying HTML elements was a fun and interesting step. I learned a lot from:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">This page</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">And this page</a></li>
            </ul>
    </body>
